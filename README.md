## INTRODUCTION
Malware detection has been an important topic in cyber security research. This report discusses some methods to detect a malware and which family it belongs to.
## FEATURES
For each application, the Drebin dataset contains a text file. The text file describes all the properties of the application. Each property belongs to one of 8 categories (S1 to S8). Then a feature vector for this application can be the occurrence of each category in the text file. For example, one application can have a feature vector of 1-12-0-3-5-67-9-4. It means that S1 category occurs 1 time, S2 occurs 12 times and so on.
